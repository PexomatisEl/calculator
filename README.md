# <ins>C++alculator :computer: 

calculator in C++

Be kind and insert only executable expressions, without using any spaces. For decimal numbers, use `.`.
Obviously you have to follow every mathematical rule. For example division with `0` is for dummies.

This calculator is capable of computing complicated arithmetic expressions, containing operators like `(`,`)`,`*`,`/`,`+`,`-`,`^` and 
also functions like `log()`,`ln()`,`tan()`,`cos()` and `sin()` of any number while being able to prioritize any given operation.

After every function a parenthesis must be used.

Numbers like e and pi are also included.

## Examples:
Lets start with an easy one :trollface:
### /color{purple}{<ins>Example (i)}

`sin(ln(sin(pi/2))-e^ln(pi))` 

**Result:**  0

And now the elementary stuff
### <ins>Example (ii)

`3.5*((2+8)/(3-1))-(5-7-1/2)`

**Result:**  20

### <ins>Example (iii)
`-(-(1-2)*log(100))`

**Result:**  -2
