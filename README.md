# C++alculator

calculator in C++

Be kind and insert only executable expressions.

This calculator is capable of compiuting complicating arithmetic expressions containing operators like `(`,`)`,`*`,`/`,`+`,`-` and 
also functions like `log()`,`ln()`,`tan()`,`cos()` and `sin()` of any number while being able to prioritize any given operation.

Obviously you have to follow every mathematical rule. For example division with `0` is for dummies.

After every function a parenthesis must be used.

Numbers like e and pi are also included.
